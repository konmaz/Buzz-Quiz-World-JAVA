**Welcome to Buzz Quiz World!**
***This repository contains the code for a Quiz Game that was developed for an assignment in the Object-Oriented Programming course.***

ORIGINAL README FILE:
> This is a Quiz similar to television shows. There are 2 types of
> rounds. There are a lot of categories with random questions each, and
> 4 potential answers to accompany them You can handle MENU and other
> options using the alphabetical keys shown in the screen before each
> option. You must press the Enter key after inserting an answer key In
> each round you answer a set number of random questions from either a
> random category or a category of your selection. By default, every
> question and round type is Random, but that can be changed before the
> start of every round (Round Menu) If you've selected a category and
> the questions presented are not from the category you originally
> selected, this means that there are no more questions remaining from
> that category and they will be presented randomly. Types of Rounds:
> 1.[Right Answer], the player gets 1000 point for every right answer and loses none when answering incorrectly
> 2.[Bet], the player places a Bet of a certain amount of points from the given options, regardless of their points. If they answer
> correctly he gains double the amount bet, while if they don't, they
> lose points equal to their initial bet.
> 
> That is all. In short, answer correctly and win! Have fun!
